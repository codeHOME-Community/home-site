#### NB: For the actual pushing etc. have a look at the main readme
To add a challenge, create a folder for the language if it doesn't already exist.
Inside the language folder, you should give your challenge it's own folder, This should have either ( `challenge.whatever` && `solution.whatever` && `explanation.txt` ) or a folder for challenge and solution, depending on which suits your language better.
These will be reordered later when the site is nearing completion
